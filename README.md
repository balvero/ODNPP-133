Organic Denmark Delete unused pages

Overview:
Anne Stine wants us to delete all website pages that isnâ€™t used anymore, so it is easier to overview. Both on the main website + shop. But the designed pages Members + International decision makers should not be deleted - i think we can use the later.

TODO:
Please review these OD pages and save a copy of the yellow-highlighted ones as HTML. You can use Confluence, notepad, or any other tools you have. Make sure we can easily locate them in case they are needed again.

You can delete them when you have created a backup. Thanks!
